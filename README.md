# AZ-104-Project: GPS (YouTube)
My 1'st attempt to showcase my technical skills while preparing for the AZ-104 exam - Thank you GPS.

I have struggled to grasp the content of AZ -104 in the past two months, Quickly realising that if I do not actually practise, I would not be confident, nor capable of working as an Azure administrator. I have two choices, memorize and cram to pass the exam (possible option) or learn to understand and confidently carry out Tasks in Azure. Thanks, GPS (check out her YouTube channel) for providing this project for free, really appreciate it.
